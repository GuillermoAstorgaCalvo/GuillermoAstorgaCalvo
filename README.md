I build things. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but I always learn something along the way. Whether it's a simple script or a complex AI system, I love the challenge of turning ideas into reality.

### 💼 **My Story**
I started coding because I wanted to build things that could actually help people. What began as simple scripts has turned into a passion for creating meaningful applications. I love the challenge of taking a complex problem and turning it into something elegant and useful.

**🔭 Right now:** Working on AI-powered real estate platforms and trying to make invoice processing less painful  
**🌱 Learning:** New AI/ML techniques, microservices, and whatever catches my interest  
**👯 Looking for:** Cool projects to collaborate on, especially open source stuff  
**💬 Ask me about:** React, TypeScript, Python, AI/ML, or anything tech-related - I love talking shop!  
**📫 Get in touch:** [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/guillermoastorgacalvo) | [Email](mailto:guillermo.astorga.calvo@gmail.com)

### 🎯 **What I Do**
- **Frontend Development**: Building interfaces that people actually want to use
- **Backend Development**: Creating APIs and services that don't break when you need them most
- **AI & ML**: Adding intelligence to applications in ways that actually make sense
- **Database & Cloud**: Making sure data is where it needs to be when it needs to be there
- **DevOps**: Automating the boring stuff so I can focus on building

</div>

Here are some projects I'm pretty proud of. Each one taught me something different and pushed me to grow.

### 🏆 **InmoIA Frontend**
🟢 Active Development • A real estate platform that actually helps people find their perfect home. Started as a simple listing site and grew into something much bigger.

**Tech Stack:** ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TailwindCSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white) ![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)

**What it does:**
- AI Property Matching
- Virtual Tours
- Analytics Dashboard

**The backstory:** This one started small - just a basic property listing. But as I worked on it, I kept thinking 'what if we could make this smarter?' Now it's a full SaaS platform. The journey from simple to complex taught me so much about scaling React apps.

### 🏆 **TypeScript Backend**
🟢 Active Development • The engine that powers everything. Built this microservices architecture to handle the heavy lifting - authentication, data processing, you name it.

**Tech Stack:** ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

**What it does:**
- REST APIs
- Authentication
- Database Management

**The backstory:** TypeScript changed everything for me. The first time I refactored this backend with proper types, I realized what I'd been missing. Now I can't imagine building anything complex without it.

### 🏆 **Python AI MCP Backend**
🟢 Active Development • This is where things get interesting. Built an AI backend that can understand what you're asking and actually do something about it.

**Tech Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-FastAPI-009688?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi&logoColor=white) ![OpenAI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-OpenAI-58A6FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=openai&logoColor=white) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

**What it does:**
- AI Task Completion
- Natural Language Processing
- MCP Integration

**The backstory:** I was skeptical about AI at first, but seeing this system understand natural language requests blew my mind. It's like having a really smart assistant that actually gets things done.

### 🏆 **FacturaIA**
🟡 In Development • Got tired of manually processing invoices, so I built something to do it for me. Sometimes the best projects come from solving your own problems.

**Tech Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

**What it does:**
- OCR Processing
- Data Extraction
- Invoice Management

**The backstory:** This was born from pure frustration. I was manually processing invoices one day and thought 'there has to be a better way.' Turns out there was - I just had to build it.

### 🏆 **Restaurant App**
🟢 Live • My first full-stack project that actually went live. Built it for a friend's restaurant and it's still running today.

**Tech Stack:** ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white) ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express.js&logoColor=white)

**What it does:**
- Order Management
- Menu System
- Admin Dashboard

**The backstory:** This was the project that made me realize I could actually build things people would use. Seeing real customers place orders through something I built was incredibly satisfying.
